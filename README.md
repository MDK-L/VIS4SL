# VIS4SL

This repo is the official Pytorch implementation of VIS4SL: "[VIS4SL: A Visual Analytic Approach for Interpreting and Diagnosing Shortcut Learning]".


## Getting Started
### Environment Requirements

First, please make sure you have installed Conda. Then, our environment can be installed by:
```
conda create -n VIS4SL python=3.9
conda activate VIS4SL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation

You can obtain Revision from [Google Drive](https://github.com/msavva/ReVision). And the 16-class ImageNet dataset can be found at [ImageNet](https://github.com/rgeirhos/generalisation-humans-DNNs). All the datasets are well pre-processed and can be used easily.

```
mkdir dataset
```
**Please put them in the `./dataset` directory**

### TODO
Opensource the frontend
